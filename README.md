# Harvest Honors Classic - Flash Era Style (Single Player)

I recreated the classic style of the beloved **Harvest Honors** game for my mom, who missed it after Flash Player was discontinued. This project contains over **600 lines of Python code** and was built using **Pygame**. I decided to share it here on GitHub for others who may also want to enjoy the game.
